# skript-test-action

skript-test-action is a GitHub Action that addon developers can use to utilize skript-test-action within their addons!
In addition to testing your own syntaxes, you can also run the vanilla Skript tests alongside your own to ensure that
your addon does not change any vanilla behavior!
